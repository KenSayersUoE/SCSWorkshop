# Abstract

## Build a Hugo Website in Azure using GitHub Actions and Azure Bicep in a day with Dev Containers

Let's build a Hugo website in Azure together using GitHub to store our code, GitHub Actions to perform the deployments, and Azure Bicep to control the state of the infrastructure, all within Dev Containers to ensure that everyoneâ€™s development experience is standardised and remove the "It worked on my machine" message!.

This one day workshop will ensure that you have a basic level of understanding in

- git for source control
- GitHub and particularly GitHub Actions
- Dev Containers for a standardised development experience
- Azure Bicep

That you can take back and use within your development teams as well as your open-source contributions.

This is an introductory session designed to help you to get your hands on the technology and get used to this way of working and communicating about change and process. We won't have the time to get deep into any of the subjects but we will give you an
excellent grounding in the core concepts and complement any existing knowledge that you have.
